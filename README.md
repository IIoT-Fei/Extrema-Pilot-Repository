# Extrema Pilot Dataset
 
  As part of the  [SWAMP Project](http://swamp-project.org) the Master's Degree project  of Gilberto Souza proposes a model for irrigation precision that use IoT distributed on an experimental field for the acquisition of climatic data, weather forecast, and the phenological development for a culture of a sweet pepper crop to model irrigation requirements of the sweet pepper obtained through a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). 

  ## Data
  ----
 Data is in CSV format and the data are on a daily scale. 
 In this file, you will find the historical data of Reference Evapotranspiration (eto), Crop Evapotranspiration (etc), Rainfall (rf), Soil Moisture (sm), FAO Irrigation (irr_fao), and Fuzzy Model Irrigation (irr_fuzzy) for a period of 08/01/2020 to 12/07/2020. The historical data can be found [here]().

 The crop used for this dataset was sweet pepper and the crop factors for each growth stage can be found [here]().

The pilot was located in the city of Extrema, MG, Brazil and the soil type of the pilot location is **Clay** with a field capacity of **39,5%**.
