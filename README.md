# Extrema Pilot Dataset
 
  As part of the  [SWAMP Project](http://swamp-project.org) the Master's Degree project  of Gilberto Souza proposes a model for irrigation precision that use IoT distributed on an experimental field for the acquisition of climatic data, weather forecast, and the phenological development for a culture of a sweet pepper crop to model irrigation requirements of the sweet pepper obtained through a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). 

  ## Data

 Data is in CSV format and the data are on a daily scale. 
 In this file, you will find the historical data of Reference Evapotranspiration (**eto**), Crop Evapotranspiration (**etc**), Rainfall (**rf**), Soil Moisture (**sm**), FAO Irrigation (**irr_fao**), and Fuzzy Model Irrigation (**irr_fuzzy**) for a period of 08/01/2020 to 12/07/2020. .

 The crop used for this dataset was sweet pepper and the crop factors for each growth stage can be found [here](https://github.com/IIoT-Fei/Extrema-Pilot-Repository/tree/master/datasets/Sweet%20Paper%20Crop%20Coefficients).

The first pilot consist on a validation of the Fuzzy Inference System proposed on a small two  pots  with  dimensions  height=0.2m,  width=0.2mand  depth=0.25m. The soil type of the pilot is **Silt Clay** with a field capacity of **36 %**. The historical data can be found [here](https://github.com/IIoT-Fei/Extrema-Pilot-Repository/tree/master/datasets/Nova%20Petropolis%20Data)

The second pilot consist on the application of the FIS was located in the city of Extrema, MG, Brazil. The soil type of the pilot location is **Clay** with a field capacity of **39,5%**. The historical data can be found [here](https://github.com/IIoT-Fei/Extrema-Pilot-Repository/tree/master/datasets/Extrema%20Pilot%20Data)

## Fuzzy Inference System

The Fuzzy inference system developed can be observed in the following image.
